# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b654c94e-08a6-4b79-b443-7837581b1d8d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms-ci/deploys)

## Prerequisites

- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)

### Access Locally

Pulldown a local copy of the Github repository Netlify created for you, with the name you specified in the previous step

```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

This uses the new [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifycms&utm_campaign=devex) CLI feature to serve any functions you have in the `lambda` folder.

To test the CMS locally, you'll need to run a production build of the site:

```
$ npm run build
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

### Media Libraries (installed, but optional)

Media Libraries have been included in this starter as a default. If you are not planning to use `Uploadcare` or `Cloudinary` in your project, you **can** remove them from module import and registration in `src/cms/cms.js`. Here is an example of the lines to comment or remove them your project.

```javascript
import CMS from "netlify-cms-app";
// import uploadcare from 'netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare'
// import cloudinary from 'netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary'

import AboutPagePreview from "./preview-templates/AboutPagePreview";
import BlogPostPreview from "./preview-templates/BlogPostPreview";
import ProductPagePreview from "./preview-templates/ProductPagePreview";
import IndexPagePreview from "./preview-templates/IndexPagePreview";

// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(uploadcare);
// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(cloudinary);

CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("index", IndexPagePreview);
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("about", AboutPagePreview);
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("products", ProductPagePreview);
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("blog", BlogPostPreview);
```

Note: Don't forget to also remove them from `package.json` and `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` using `yarn` or `npm`. During the build netlify-cms-app will bundle the media libraries as well, having them removed will save you build time.
Example:

```
yarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare
```

OR

```
yarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary
```

## Getting Started (Without Netlify)

```
$ gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/
$ cd [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME]
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```

## Purgecss

This plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma builds are usually ~170K but reduced 90% by purgecss.
